## Project Specific

### Chunked Work Approach

Always break complex tasks into small chunks (3-7 parts). Complete only one chunk at a time, then stop and ask: "Should I proceed to the next chunk: [description]?"

Wait for user confirmation before continuing. Never complete an entire complex task in one response.

**Chunk Guidelines:**

* 1-2 minutes of work maximum
* Clear deliverable per chunk
* Stop after each completion
* Get explicit approval to proceed
